As a timid child of 10 years raised in the laidback coastal community of La Jolla, California, Marco Baroudi was not prepared for his impending jaunt to public recognition. On a cool winter day at La Jolla Shores, Marco was spotted in the lineup by a world renown photographer, Peter King. Peter urged Marco’s mother to get him signed with an agency working in the print modeling industry. The following day, he was driven to Los Angeles for his first casting with H&M, the multinational Swedish fashion giant. Marco hadn’t an inkling that in the coming months and following years, the child modeling industry would shape the ways in which a young boy saw himself and the world at large.
